# react2shell-scanner

A command-line tool for detecting CVE-2025-55182 and CVE-2025-66478 in Next.js applications using React Server Components.

For technical details on the vulnerability and detection methodology, see our blog post: https://slcyber.io/research-center/high-fidelity-detection-mechanism-for-rsc-next-js-rce-cve-2025-55182-cve-2025-66478

## How It Works

By default, the scanner sends a crafted multipart POST request containing an RCE proof-of-concept payload that executes a deterministic math operation (`41*271 = 11111`). Vulnerable hosts return the result in the `X-Action-Redirect` response header as `/login?a=11111`.

The scanner tests the root path first. If not vulnerable, it follows same-host redirects (e.g., `/` to `/en/`) and tests the redirect destination. Cross-origin redirects are not followed.

### Safe Check Mode

The `--safe-check` flag uses an alternative detection method that relies on side-channel indicators (500 status code with specific error digest) without executing code on the target. Use this mode when RCE execution is not desired.

### WAF Bypass

The `--waf-bypass` flag prepends random junk data to the multipart request body. This can help evade WAF content inspection that only analyzes the first portion of request bodies. The default size is 128KB, configurable via `--waf-bypass-size`. When WAF bypass is enabled, the timeout is automatically increased to 20 seconds (unless explicitly set).

### Windows Mode

The `--windows` flag switches the payload from Unix shell (`echo $((41*271))`) to PowerShell (`powershell -c "41*271"`) for targets running on Windows.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- requests
- tqdm

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Scan a single host:

```
python3 scanner.py -u https://example.com
```

Scan a list of hosts:

```
python3 scanner.py -l hosts.txt
```

Scan with multiple threads and save results:

```
python3 scanner.py -l hosts.txt -t 20 -o results.json
```

Scan with custom headers:

```
python3 scanner.py -u https://example.com -H "Authorization: Bearer token" -H "Cookie: session=abc"
```

Use safe side-channel detection:

```
python3 scanner.py -u https://example.com --safe-check
```

Scan Windows targets:

```
python3 scanner.py -u https://example.com --windows
```

Scan with WAF bypass:

```
python3 scanner.py -u https://example.com --waf-bypass
```

## Options

```
-u, --url         Single URL to check
-l, --list        File containing hosts (one per line)
-t, --threads     Number of concurrent threads (default: 10)
--timeout         Request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
-o, --output      Output file for results (JSON)
--all-results     Save all results, not just vulnerable hosts
-k, --insecure    Disable SSL certificate verification
-H, --header      Custom header (can be used multiple times)
-v, --verbose     Show response details for vulnerable hosts
-q, --quiet       Only output vulnerable hosts
--no-color        Disable colored output
--safe-check      Use safe side-channel detection instead of RCE PoC
--windows         Use Windows PowerShell payload instead of Unix shell
--waf-bypass      Add junk data to bypass WAF content inspection
--waf-bypass-size Size of junk data in KB (default: 128)
```

## Output

Results are printed to the terminal. When using `-o`, vulnerable hosts are saved to a JSON file containing the full HTTP request and response for verification.
